## Variables in Python
Variables are containers for storing data values.

##Summary of these assignment
We will be learning in deep how to name vartiable some code how we can add them delete or add in end for this we will be using insert(), remove(), 

### Syntax
```python
x = 10
name = "Anurag"

Rules for Variable Names
Must start with a letter or underscore

Cannot start with a number

Case-sensitive

Which of the following identifier names are invalid and why? 
Serial_no 
1st_Roo 
Hundred 
Total_Mark 
total-Mark 
Total Marks 
Tru 
_Percentag 

Answer: 1st_Roo, Total Marks, total-Mark are invalid as we cannot have namespace in between, we cannot use integer in starting the variables, we cannot use any special characters other than underscore

Write the corresponding Python assignment statements: 
Assign 10 to variable length and 20 to variable breadth
val_length = 10
val_breadth = 20
print(f"The lenth is {val_length} and the breadth is {val_breadth}")

Assign the average of values of variables length and breadth to a variable sum 
val_length = 10
val_breadth = 20
sum = (val_length + val_breadth)/2
print(f"The average is {sum}")

Assign a list containing strings 'Paper', 'Gel Pen', and 'Eraser' to a variable stationery 

string_stationery = ['Paper', 'Gel Pen', 'Eraser']
print(f"Stationery list is as follow {string_stationery}")

Assign the strings 'Mohandas', 'Karamchand', and 'Gandhi' to variables first, middle and last
first = "Mohandas"
middle = "Karamchand"
last = "Gandhi"
print(first)
print(middle)
print(last)
Assign the concatenated value of string variables first, middle, and last to variable fullname. 
first = "Mohandas"
middle = "Karamchand"
last = "Gandhi"

fullname = first + middle + last

if spacing is required:
fullname = first + " " + middle + " " + last
print(fullname)
print(fullname)


name = ["Mohan", "dash", "karam", "chandra","gandhi","Bapu"]  do the following operations in this list; 
add an element "freedom_fighter" in this list at the 0th index 
find the output of the following ,and explain how? 

name = ["Mohan", "dash", "karam", "chandra", "gandhi","Bapu"]
name.insert(0,"freedom_fighter")
print(name)

we can insert by using insert() function in python we can do it by mentioning the index -> (0,-----)

add two more elements in the name ["NetaJi","Bose"] at the end of the list
-> This can be done using append() function it's a inbuilt function in pyton which will move it to the end.
->name = ["Mohan", "dash", "karam", "chandra", "gandhi","Bapu"]
->name.append('Netaji')
->name.append('Bose')
 
what will be the value of temp:  
name = ["Bapuji", "dash", "karam", "chandra","gandi","Mohan"]  temp=name[-1]  name[-1]=name[0]  name[0]=temp  print(name) 
-> Let's go step wise
-> name = ["Bapuji", "dash", "karam", "chandra","gandi","Mohan"]
-> temp = name[-1] #temp is last element that is mohan
-> name[-1] = name[0] last elemet change to bapuji
-> name[0] = temp #temp = mohan

Output: ["Mohan", "Dash", "Karam", " Chandra", "Gandhi", "Bapuji"]
