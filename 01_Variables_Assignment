## Variables in Python
Variables are containers for storing data values.

### Syntax
```python
x = 10
name = "Anurag"

Rules for Variable Names
Must start with a letter or underscore

Cannot start with a number

Case-sensitive

Which of the following identifier names are invalid and why? 
Serial_no 
1st_Roo 
Hundred 
Total_Mark 
total-Mark 
Total Marks 
Tru 
_Percentag 

Answer: 1st_Roo, Total Marks, total-Mark are invalid as we cannot have namespace in between, we cannot use integer in starting the variables, we cannot use any special characters other than underscore

Write the corresponding Python assignment statements: 
Assign 10 to variable length and 20 to variable breadth
val_length = 10
val_breadth = 20
print(f"The lenth is {val_length} and the breadth is {val_breadth}")

Assign the average of values of variables length and breadth to a variable sum 
val_length = 10
val_breadth = 20
sum = (val_length + val_breadth)/2
print(f"The average is {sum}")

Assign a list containing strings 'Paper', 'Gel Pen', and 'Eraser' to a variable stationery 

string_stationery = ['Paper', 'Gel Pen', 'Eraser']
print(f"Stationery list is as follow {string_stationery}")

Assign the strings 'Mohandas', 'Karamchand', and 'Gandhi' to variables first, middle and last
first = "Mohandas"
middle = "Karamchand"
last = "Gandhi"
print(first)
print(middle)
print(last)
Assign the concatenated value of string variables first, middle, and last to variable fullname. 
first = "Mohandas"
middle = "Karamchand"
last = "Gandhi"

fullname = first + middle + last

if spacing is required:
fullname = first + " " + middle + " " + last
print(fullname)
print(fullname)
